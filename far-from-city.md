# chapter 0: he desists under the pierced roof.

It was cold in there, whiteish wind, maybe accompanied by the fog or smoke of fire burnt somewhere, it was cinematic. As if he was put into the world of sophistication. The environment was the epitome of nature. The vehicle, he was coming with, an old rusty car was sheerly drenched by the light rain that was ubiquitous near him.

He mumbles expressing annoyance at the adhesive shirt that was also weighing high, for it held more than half a litre of rain. Being cautious, the car was parked somewhere safe near the brown bushes. Regular drops of water could be heard falling over the dried brown leaf of the giant tree that was right next to it. Although the poor dismantled house, it was sufficient to give the exhausted rider a little rest from the water somewhere outside the car.

But then there were two packets of burgers, he gets two of them, preventing the rain from invading that hot one. Interesting turbulence passes over the burger that he just exposed to the surrounding. He sees nothing but a delicious meal awaiting him for more than an hour now. Lucky that pair of burgers who could get heat from the scorching engine. It was so good that the existential crisis that was running through him lost somewhere. It felt good like nothing. It was all heaven. The lettuce that was crunchy and sweet was perfect to flood the hungry mouth with saliva. When the bites go on, he can’t feel anything other than the rich smell radiating with heat. Now, the tummy feels good and the eyes have the strength to see around. Those eyes could find a wooden dry bench inside. With no more think, he lays over it with a long, deep breath relinquishing the tiredness from all over the body. Just energized eyes now are completely shut and the nap he takes goes for an hour.

When the exhausted mind was pondering through the axioms of ‘Group Theory’. The book of mathematics was engulfed inside the minuscule rack of the rusty car which now smells irony. Because the icy water touched every outer part of the car, the outerior area of the car is like the friend that you need but don’t want to be involved with. Weird but amusing noises made by the dried brown leaves but now all wet was soothing, of which consequence was another hour-long nap. When stayed still, one could hear subtle playful sounds of birds. Covering most of the room, peaceful silence was there shielding him from the obsolete rush of the outside world. It was just nature where there were no propositions to be fulfilled; no arguments to settle. Time would be the joy itself.
